This application allows to perform steganography and cryptography processes using digital images as information carriers.

First option (steganography) uses .png files as cover-image to hide (and later recover) secret text message as either plaintext or cryptogram through LSB method. Polish characters are supported only when secret message is in form of a plaintext (utf-8 encoding) in contrary to being encrypted before embedding (latin-1 encoding).

Cryptography functionality lets the user encrypt (and later decrypt) a confidential image using AES algorithm and make it unreadable to any operating system.

When encrypting either text or image, the encryption mode can be chosen by the user. Two available modes are CFB and CBC.
