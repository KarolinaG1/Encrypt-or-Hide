This application allows to perform steganography and cryptography processes using digital images as information carriers.

First option (steganography) uses .png files as cover-image to hide (and later uncover) secret text message as either plaintext or cryptogram through LSB method. Polish characters are supported only when secret message is in form of a plaintext (utf-8 encoding), in contrary to being encrypted before embedding (latin-1 encoding).
Cryptography functionality lets the user encrypt (and later decrypt) a confidential image using AES algorithm and make it unreadable to any operating system.

When encrypting either text or image, the encryption mode can be chosen by the user. Two available modes are CFB and CBC.
When performing embedding of the message, statistics of the process are given. Information include: percentage of bits changed in the process, as well as PSNR and MSE values as indicators of severity of changes made to the cover image.
